# DiabetesPrediction
Diabetes is the target variable being predicted

The Diabetes Prediction Dataset.csv file contains medical and demographic data of patients along with their diabetes status, whether positive or negative. It consists of various features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The Dataset can be utilized to construct machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on their medical history and demographic details.


# Analysing
In here we train 7 models on the data and predict the test set and then check the CAP curve.

By CAP curve we recognize that all the models have a good prediction.

At last we check the accuracy of the models and get that Random Forest Classification has the best accuracy(97 percent).
